# Probability & Risk Simulation (Excel)

This project demonstrates how probability concepts can be applied to real-world
business decisions using Excel.

## Objective
- Simulate uncertain outcomes using random number generation
- Estimate expected value and measure risk using standard deviation
- Analyze profit/loss scenarios through repeated trials

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Probability & statistics concepts

## Methodology
- Generated random numbers to simulate probabilistic outcomes
- Assigned outcomes based on defined probability assumptions
- Calculated expected value and risk across 100+ simulations

## Key Takeaways
- Demonstrates analytical thinking and Excel proficiency
- Shows practical application of probability theory
- Relevant to business analytics and accounting contexts
